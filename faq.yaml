    - title: Why is this server called the matchbox?
      description: >
        It's a reference to a poem by A. A. Milne! You can read the poem, or hear it read, 
        by clicking [here](https://voetica.com/voetica.php?collection=3&poet=685&poem=3357).

    - title: Why doesn't the server have custom color roles or role icons?
      description: >
        Color roles are inaccessible, and we'd like it to be very clear at a glance who our mod team are.
        We've put a lot of thought into making sure the colored roles we do have are distinct. 
        In addition, by coloring or adding icons to pronoun roles we'd have to sort one above the other.
        
        
        The color roles available to users not on our staff team are gained either by boosting the server or 
        contributing significant art to the server.

    - title: Why doesn't the sever have roles for timezones, pings, DMs open, or anything else?
      description: >
        We have a limited amount of role slots, and don't see a significant benefit in adding these roles.
        If you'd like to have this information available to other members of the server, we encourage you
        to put it in your about me or nickname. See below for more details on changing your nickname in this server.

    - title: Why doesn't the sever have a venting channel, politics channel, or meme channel?
      description: >
        These channels are staples of many Discord communities, but we've made the intentional choice to not have them
        in the matchbox. You can read about venting and other sensitive topics in <#1036441120789508206>. 
        
        
        Politics tend to be a very inflammatory topic, and the previous matchbox encountered this issue.
        Politics channels are difficult to moderate, and this server has no relation to politics.
        However, human rights are not political, and we stand in support of historically marginalized communities.


        We don't have a meme channel for similar reasons. Memes devoid of context tend to slip into areas of humor
        that are not appropriate for the matchbox. We're not asking you to avoid memes in conversations, 
        we're asking you to avoid memes divorced from conversations or channel topics. Memes can be great fun, 
        just please be conscientious about them.

    - title: Does the matchbox have a Minecraft server?
      description: >
        Sadly, no. We'd quite like to provide this as a community space, but it would require a large amount of 
        moderator energy we're not currently able to expend. We'll revisit this topic in the future. It's totally
        fine to make your own server with friends from the matchbox, but please be clear that it's not associated with
        the matchbox. Calling your server "The Unofficial Matchbox Minecraft Server" won't fly.

    - title: My favorite bot isn't here! What bots does the matchbox use and why?
      description: >
        We make use of 7 bots: 
        
        - Matchbox Modmail (<@1039564311196082257>) is an instance of 
        [Dragory's Modmail](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot) that we run. DM it to contact our mod team.
        
        - Beemo (<@515067662028636170>) prevents against raids. 
        
        - LilyBot (<@876278900836139008>) is a general-purpose bot developed by <@554057150066982937> to provide 
        utility and moderation tools.
        
        - PluralKit (<@466378653216014359>) is an accessibility tool for members of plural systems. You can find more 
        info on it in <#1036441120789508206>. 
        
        - SoundCloud (<@890343617762304070>) is the official Discord bot of SoundCloud and allows users to play
        the vast majority of tracks on SoundCloud. You can read more below on why we've chosen this particular
        music bot.
        
        - TeXit (<@510789298321096704>) allows for rendering of complex math equations using LaTeX.
        
        - TweetShift (<@713026372142104687>) is a Twitter feed bot that allows us to have <#1030479317785915465>.
        
        
        
        There are a handful of bots that we've specifically chosen not to use: 
      
        - Music bots tend to be against the terms of service of whatever platform they're pulling music from.
        We have SoundCloud's official bot, and we encourage you to use Discord's built-in YouTube 
        "Watch Together" Activity. If you have Spotify Premium, you can use its "Listen Along" feature.
        
        - Levelling bots tend to encourage spamming behavior and create exclusivity based on message counts.
        There are no rewards for talking more other than getting to be part of the community.
        Send messages when you have something to say.
        
        - Starboard bots tend to result in people aiming to end up on the starboard. They create unhealthy
        competition over number of stars earned, or potential hurt feelings. People also are unable to opt out
        if they don't want their messages included. These are the same reasons we don't have a quotes channel. 
        If you enjoy something, express that appreciation with words or reactions.

      description: >
        If you're sharing something you've made for the sake of sharing it, and it happens to be on an external page,
        that's lovely and fine. We very much appreciate you sharing your wonderful work. However, promoting simply
        for the sake of promoting is prohibited.
