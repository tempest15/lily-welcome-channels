        Welcome to the matchbox, the official server for the musical artist beetlebug! 
        This is a space to be creative, make friends and hang out with people with similar interests :)

        Please make sure you have read and understood the rules and information below before 
        continuing to the rest of the server. These rules are primarily based on the rules of 
        [The Quilt Community](https://quiltmc.org/en/community/rules/).
        
        **Not knowing the rules is not an excuse to break them.** If you have any confusion about the rules,
        please ask in

- type: rules

  rules:
    Be decent to one another: >
      Any and all forms of bigotry, harassment, doxxing, exclusionary or otherwise abusive behavior will not be 
      tolerated. Excessive rudeness, impatience, and hostility are not welcome. 
      Do not rage out or make personal attacks against other people. 
      Do not encourage users to brigade/raid other communities. Do not impersonate other people, bots, or companies.
    Follow Discord's rules: >
      As this is a primarily a Discord based community, it's important to be aware of and follow Discord's 
      [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). 
      Notable, you must be 13 or older. Anyone found to be younger than 13 will be banned immediately.
    Try to speak English: >
      The common language in our community is English, but we understand that not everyone speaks English at the same
      level. Try to speak English to the best of your ability, and don't worry if you need to use translation tools. We
      will not tolerate making fun of people for poor English.
    Listen to and respect moderators: >
      Moderators are here to keep the community safe and make sure everything runs smoothly. 
      In order to do their jobs effectively, they need you to cooperate with them. 
      Please take requests from moderators seriously. If you have an issue with a moderation action, 
      please #message-a-mod or DM an admin.
    Keep chat clean: >
      Do not spam text, images, user mentions, emojis, reactions, or anything else. 
      Do not post offensive, obscene, politically charged, or sexually explicit content. 
      Uploading or directly linking to executable files is not allowed without prior approval. 
      When uploading large batches of images, consider using a paste site. 
      Please use fonts that are easy to read and can be typed on an english keyboard.
    Follow the channel topic and don't derail discussions: >
      Many of our channels have specific topics, and we'd ask that you stick to them. 
      We understand that conversations may span multiple topics and move onto something else, 
      but we may ask you to move if a conversation leaves the scope of a channelâ€™s topic. 
      Additionally, when entering a channel with an active discussion, 
      please be mindful of that discussion and do not try to derail it (by talking over it, for example). 
      We have multiple general (off-topic) channels you can use if a channel is busy.
    Donâ€™t import drama or controversy from other communities: >
      We aim to be a safe place for everyone â€” regardless of their background, identity, or other defining trait. 
      In order to do this, itâ€™s important that people are allowed to interact without having to worry about 
      controversies from other communities that they may be seeking refuge from. If youâ€™d like to discuss 
      controversies with other users, start a DM group or join a community thatâ€™s designed to handle that discussion.
    Additional notes: >
      - Please do not ping or DM beetlebug. They are very busy.
      If you need to contact them about a business matter, please use beetleboyinbox@gmail.com
      
      - These rules apply to non-message mediums as well. This includes nicknames, avatars, Discord bios, 
        and custom/rich statuses.
      
      - If you have been subject to a moderation action you'd like to appeal, please DM an admin.

    - title: Reporting

      description: >
        To report rule breaking, please mention the `@Moderators` role. 
        You may also right click or long press on a message, navigate to the apps menu, 
        and select the `Report` option. In addition, you can #message-a-mod. 
        Please do not DM individual moderators about rule breaking behavior. 
        If you have a concern with a moderator's behavior, DM an admin. 
        Any private reports will be treated confidentially.

    - title: Discussion of sensitive/triggering topics

      description: >
        We ask you to kindly refrain from discussing topics that may be sensitive or triggering to others in this 
        server. We are sadly not able to provide a space to discuss these topics, or for venting/trauma dumping.
        We've placed this restriction because such situations can easily get out of hand, and are also difficult
        on the mental health of the moderation team.
        
        
        However, you don't have to struggle alone. You may absolutely ask if someone is willing to DM about an 
        issue you are facing. You can find additional mental health resources at https://checkpointorg.com/global/ and 
        https://thehaven.support/. If you have additional resources you'd like us to link here, please share them.

    - title: Plurality & PluralKit

      description: >
        This server makes use of the Discord bot [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) as an accessibility tool.
        [Plural systems](https://morethanone.info/), or groups residing inside the same physical brain, may use 
        PluralKit to make their message appear with the correct profile information. 
        These messages show up with a bot tag due to Discord's limitations. 
        If you want to see what system/account a specific message is from, 
        you can react to the message using :question:.

        We ask that only people who are part of plural systems, or utilise PluralKit as a mental health aid, 
        make use of it. To those using PluralKit, we recommend that you put your system tag into your display name, 
        to make things easier to understand. 

        Any attacking of PluralKit users counts as discrimination and will be moderated harshly.
