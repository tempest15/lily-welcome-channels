# Moderator guidelines for the matchbox
This document outlines a basic idea of what’s expected of our moderators (as well as the staff team in general) 
and provides some advice for team members that may be in a pinch. It is heavily based on 
QuiltMC's [moderation guidelines](https://quiltmc.org/en/staff/moderation/moderation/) with some small changes to 
fit the matchbox's community.

## Moderation as a Concept
Moderation is, at its core, the front lines of community safety. Moderators are responsible for keeping the 
members of their community safe, by resolving disputes and removing problematic people from the community.

There are many ways to approach moderation, and they’re all effective in different ways. 
We prefer to take a proactive approach – addressing issues as early as possible and preventing problematic 
people ever from joining the community when we can. For this reason, we encourage our moderators to be active 
participants in the community as well, joining the other users in discussions and otherwise participating the 
same way everyone else does.

## Qualities of a Moderator
Every moderator has their own personality and thought process, but we do expect a number of things from every 
team member:
- A relatively active presence in our community, with genuine participation
- A wish to improve the community and support its members
- A relatively cool approach to problem users, allowing the team member to deal with the issue rather than 
engaging problematic mentalities
- An understanding of (or willingness to learn about) the unique challenges that minority communities are faced 
with, and a willingness to apply that knowledge practically and consistently to the moderation process
- A non-judgemental approach to those in differing circumstances – people with differing (non-harmful) viewpoints, 
religions, identities, etc


We ask that all moderators pledge to put the needs of the community above their own personal viewpoints. 
That said, all team members are people and real life comes first – team members are not expected to sacrifice 
their quality of life for the sake of the matchbox community.

## Discord Moderation Tools
Our moderator tools are provided by [LilyBot](https://github.com/HyacinthBots/LilyBot). 
This bot provides a set of standard moderation commands, as well as some lightweight automation. 
It makes use of a phishing extension to remove malicious links.

When issuing infractions, moderators must use Lily’s commands. All Lily commands are slash commands, and moderators 
can look at [this document](https://github.com/HyacinthBots/LilyBot/blob/main/docs/commands.md) for more information 
on how these commands work.

Lily has been configured so moderation actions are logged publicly. If you don't want users to know about a 
command you've run you may run it in our private bot channels command. All moderation actions are also logged to 
private channels.

## Discord Infraction Policy
When issuing infractions, moderators should bear the following points in mind:
- Consider the severity of the violation – lower-tier offences are better met with a temporary mute 
(assuming the user doesn't listen), whereas more serious offences such as hate speech and discrimination 
may be met with a quick ban, depending on the severity.
- Consider the user’s history in our community, and outside it – do they have a record of previous 
infractions? Are they usually a prolific, positive member of the community or are they brand new? 
Are they infamous for causing trouble in other communities?
- Consider the user’s personal circumstances – do they have any disabilities or social circumstances
that may cloud their judgement or give them a less favourable view of the issue at hand?
If they’re just generally being disruptive, it’s often helpful to read past the words they’re using and try to 
understand the root of the point they’re trying to make.

All discussions of moderation actions should take place in moderator-exclusive channels.

## Handling Appeals
Appeals are handled through an instance of Dragory's [modmailbot](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot). 
You can find a list of commands [here](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot/blob/master/docs/commands.md). 
You will need to join the server specifically for communicating with the bot, 
which you can find a link to pinned in the moderators channel on Discord.

If a user DMs you looking to contact moderators, or apply for a staff position, instruct them to use the bot. 
**Moderators should not communicate about official business through DMs**. For a user to DM the bot, 
they need a mutual server. If a user has been banned, 
you should send them the appropriate link that is pinned in the moderators channel on Discord, 
so they can join the server for appeals. Do not join this server yourself.

If a user or their friends react negatively to a moderation action, do your best to direct them to the appeals 
process and move the conversation along. Engaging with their argument will generally cause more problems.

The moderation team is human and mistakes can happen – but regardless of whether someone submitting an appeal 
agrees with their infractions, they’re expected to approach their appeal with civility and respect. 
Appeals should address the infraction reason (assuming the user is aware of it).

**Please note:** While the appeals system exists to allow us to rectify mistakes 
(and as a way for users who had infractions placed on them to come back later and prove that they’ve grown, 
understand the issue and are willing to work towards fixing their reputation), the moderation team still reserves 
the right to deny appeals for any reason other than infractions made in clear violation of the moderation guidelines. 
The safety of the users in our community is of utmost importance, and appeals will not be successful if the 
person submitting an appeal is still considered to be a threat to the safety of our users – both physical and 
psychological.

Appeals made for lesser infractions may result in a more significant infraction if the person appealing 
fails to approach their appeal with respect, or attempts to abuse our mod team or appeals process.

## Health & Safety
All moderators are human, and we care for the health of everyone that contributes to a healthy 
atmosphere in our community. Team members should always keep the following points in mind:
- **Prioritise your health over moderation.** Get enough sleep, drink enough water, and take time off if you need it. 
Nothing is worth burning out over, and it’s important that you look after yourself before taking care of the 
community – real life always comes first.
- **Remember that you’re a volunteer.** All staff members are here on a voluntary basis,
and we don’t require a time commitment from any of them. It’s up to each individual team member to decide how much
time they can spend on the community.
- **You do not have to handle every situation.** There are multiple moderators in our community, and some of 
us are more comfortable dealing with some situations than others may be. If you find that a situation is 
affecting you negatively, causing you to feel emotionally charged or affecting a psychological trigger, 
feel free to request that another team member handles the situation – and step away.

It’s extremely important that you take care of yourself before you worry about the needs of the community. 
You cannot effectively moderate unless you’re in the right frame of mind.

## General Advice
While every situation is unique and must be dealt with directly, the following tips may aid moderators when things 
get difficult, or to avoid problematic situations entirely. Remember to look after yourself, and try to approach 
these situations with a clear mind when possible. Additionally, it helps to remember even though Discord has a 
minimum age of 13, it’s likely that we do have members that are younger than this – for this reason, it is a top 
priority to remove users that are at risk of endangering any minors.
- **Read and understand the rules.** Read over them a few times, and try to understand the thought process behind 
them. Refer back to specific rules by number when you issue an infraction.
- **Get to know the community.** Be present and genuine in discussions, and take part in the community. 
The users will need to get to know you both as a person and moderator, and this will help to build 
trust and encourage them to behave themselves. You’ll also get to know the active community members, and learn
how they communicate and behave.
- **Do not tolerate discriminatory behaviour.** Everyone has a right to feel safe, and it’s your job as a 
moderator to ensure that our community is a safe one. All hateful and discriminatory behaviour will alienate 
community members and make them feel unwelcome, and you should be quick to moderate it.
- **Be ready to de-escalate heated situations.** Everyone has strong opinions, and disagreements will happen – 
it’s only natural. As a moderator, you should be ready to step in when discussions become too heated, 
problematic or unhealthy. Encourage users to try to understand each other’s viewpoints, and focus on resolving 
the conflict. If this is not possible then be firm in asking the users to move on from the subject, but 
empathetic to the users that are getting emotional. Everyone is human, and infractions and channel locks 
should only be issued as a last resort in these situations.
- **Be consistent with the rest of the staff team.** Our policies are in place for a reason, and the staff team 
needs to be internally consistent to help build trust with the users. Policy-related discourse is fine, but try 
to keep the timing, messaging and placement appropriate – in the heat of the moment, it may be best to disagree 
in an internal channel at first, especially if you’re unsure why an action was taken.
- **Be your best self.** We’re all human, but staff team members are expected to provide a good example of 
how to behave in our community spaces. Try your best to keep a level head, and consider stepping away from 
situations that negatively affect you on a personal level.
- **Make use of your peers.** The rest of the staff team is here to support you if you’re unsure how to 
proceed with a situation. However, if you’re unable to contact anyone, don’t wait around for too long – 
sometimes you will have to make a difficult call on your own, and there is often no ideal outcome for a situation.
- **Consider the composition of the community.** Our community is home to a diverse range of people, spanning 
various racial, identity-related and sexuality-based groups. This should all factor into your decision-making, 
and you should think about it when evaluating the points people are making.

## Closing Notes
While this document does its best to act as an aid for the moderation team, there’s no way a single document can 
cover everything there is to know. Moderators are expected to learn on the job, and the world is constantly 
changing – however, any explicit policies we come up with will be documented. If you'd like to learn more about 
moderation in general, the [Discord Moderator Academy](https://discord.com/moderation) is a solid resource.

At the end of the day, everyone in the community (whether they’re moderators or not) is human, and we expect 
everyone to be treated that way. We can all work together to build a safe, friendly, inclusive environment 
for everyone, and we all have a responsibility to do that – not just the moderators!
